## Purpose

BitDAO aims to facilitate the growth of AE communities such as Game7, BitNetwork, and EduDAO. Many AEs use events to activate and grow their communities. The Events and Operations unit will aggregate information and apply best practices across the ecosystem.

## Event Planning Flow

Event operations occurs in three main flows:

1.  Event Proposal: Events are proposed by the core events team or an AE. They use google docs to define the event's purpose/value. All this will be tracked through Airtable. Once an event is approved it will be consumed onto the BitDAO website through Airtable tagging.

2.  Planning & Execution: Once approved, events will be further defined via google docs. When an event is ready to be published, an event page will be created using Luma. This will be tracked into the Airtable.

3.  Marketing & Communications: We will use platforms such as Devpost and Event Degens to boost signal, while still referring back to the event's Luma page for invite management. We will communicate to participants through Discord, Twitter, Telegram, and the Luma mail list. External marketing will take place on Twitter, Discord, Medium.

## FAQ

**Q: How do we display current events on the BitDAO website?**

A: We will use Luma's API to pull events + metadata onto the BitDAO website.

Example:

**Q: How will CRM contacts be managed across different events and partners?**

A: Only the Events Ops unit will be responsible for aggregating event contacts. They will maintain a policy of respecting a participant's engagement within certain event contexts. For instance, if a user signs up for an EduDAO event, they will not be signed for a BitNetwork mail list.

Any cross-pollination between partners will be done as a high-touch personal invitation (eg. introducing a blockchain dev from EduDAO to Game7 via Telegram or email).

**Q: How will multiple entities use Luma to plan events?**

A: Luma supports multiple host accounts underneath the same 'organization'. Thus we can give every partner a host account (eg. BitNetwork, EduDAO, Sozu accounts) while all existing underneath a BitDAO organization.

Example:

**Q: Which layers of the tool stack are owned by the Events Ops team, and which by the partner (EduDAO/BitNetwork/etc.)?**

A: Event Ops will be responsible for organizing the Google Drive, AirTable, project management software (Monday/Notion?), and facilitating communication in Telegram or Slack

Partners will own their own communication channels such as: event-specific Telegrams, Twitter.
